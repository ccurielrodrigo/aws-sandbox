# EC2 Container Deployment Showcase

This project demonstrates how to deploy a containerized application to an EC2 instance. It includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the deployment process when changes are pushed to a specific branch.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the steps needed to deploy a Docker container to an EC2 instance using GitHub Actions, enabling a streamlined and automated deployment pipeline.

## Getting Started

To deploy the container, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the Container:**
   - Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Review the Deployment Workflow:**
   - Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to understand the GitHub Actions workflow.
   - The workflow is triggered by changes pushed to the `qf-26-auto-aws-deploy` branch and handles deployment to the specified EC2 instance.

3. **Make and Push Changes:**
   - If you want to deploy updates, make changes to the codebase and push them to the `qf-26-auto-aws-deploy` branch. This will automatically trigger the workflow to redeploy the container on EC2.
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin qf-26-auto-aws-deploy
   ```

4. **Access the Deployed Application:**
   - Visit the AWS Console to check deployment status: [AWS Console (ap-northeast-1)](https://ap-northeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=ap-northeast-1).
   - Open the public IP address of the `stg-test` EC2 instance to view the deployed application: [http://ec2-52-194-219-13.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/](http://ec2-52-194-219-13.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/).

## Requirements

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed to run and test the container locally.
- **GitHub Access**: Have permissions to push changes to the `qf-26-auto-aws-deploy` branch.
- **AWS EC2 Access**: Access to the AWS Console to monitor deployment and retrieve the public IP address of the `stg-test` instance if necessary.

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) is designed to:

1. Build the Docker container.
2. Deploy the container to the specified EC2 instance.
3. Notify upon successful deployment.

Refer to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for more details on the automation steps.

### Notes

- Ensure that any sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, is securely stored and referenced in the workflow via GitHub Secrets.
